# universalturingmachine

This was a project I put together in conjunction with Roger Penrose's *The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics*.  It includes the Universal Turing Machine specified at the end of Chapter 2 *Algorithms and Turing Machines*.

UniversalTuringMachine/machines contains these files:
* Machines
    * Universal
        * "UTM.txt": the encoded Universal Turing Machine for use by the program
        * "UTM -- decoded.txt": the decoded Universal Turing Machine for illustrative purposes, showing the 200 state transitions for the machine; generated by opening UTM.txt in the program and clicking "Show Machine"
        * "universal turing machine.txt": the Univeral Turing Machine specification as presented in the book; "UTM.txt" is simply this file with "U=" and CRLFs removed
    * Non-universal
        * "tm UNplus1.txt": a Turing Machine for incrementing a number by one, where that number is encoded in _unary_ format
        * "tm XNplus1.txt": a Turing Machine for incrementing a number by one, where that number is encoded in Penrose's _expanded binary_ format
* Inputs for machines
    * For the Universal Turing Machine (UTM.txt):
        * "utm UNPlus1 and 3 input.txt": the UNplus1 machine, and the decimal value 3 in _unary_ format
        * "utm XMplus1 and 0 input.txt": the XNplus1 machine, and the decimal value 0 in _expanded binary_ format
    * For non-universal machines
        * "input 3 for UNplus1.txt": the decimal value 3 in _unary_ format, to be used by the UNplus1 machine
        * "input 0 for XNplus1.txt": the value 0 in _expanded binary_ format, to be used by the XNplus1 machine
        * "input 167 for XNplus1.txt": the decimal value 167 in _expanded binary_ format, to be used by the XNplus1 machine

# Trying Things Out
![](main.png?raw=true)

Click "Load TM" to read in a Turing Machine (universal or not).  One of the files above will work.  Once you've loaded a machine, you can click "Show Machine" to view the machine in "decoded" form, i.e., showing the state transitions.  Results will be undetermined if you try to load a file that does not represent a Turing Machine (or if the machine is incorrectly specified).

Click "Load Input" to read in the input for the loaded machine.  Results will be undetermined if you load a file that isn't input for the loaded machine.

Once you've got a machine and its input loaded, you can click "Run".  This will apply the machine to its input and show the output when it's done.  The output (as shown in the "Output" area) shows status messages, the starting "tape" of the machine (as a series of 0s and 1s), the ending "tape", and a caret showing the position of the machine on the "tape".  Here's the output after loading the UNplus1 machine and its input 3 then clicking Run:

Ticking "Show states" will include the machine's state transitions in the output.  Ticking "Show 'tape'" will include the changes to the "tape" at each state transition in the output.  Here's the run of UNplus1 with input 3, with those boxes checked:

NOTE: take care when ticking these boxes for the universal turing machine--the machine can process its input much faster than the UI can update, so it may appear that the UI is hung while it's trying to catch up.
